# Progress Bar

A simple progress bar implementation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The progress bar is a visual element that fills up as the user scrolls down a page. It provides a visual representation of the user's progress in scrolling through the content.

## Features

- Responsive progress bar that adapts to the size of the viewport.
- Smooth animation when the progress bar fills up.
- Easy to integrate into any web page.

## Usage
```markdown
1. Include the following HTML structure in your web page:

```html
<div id="progress-bar"></div>
```

2. Add the provided CSS styles to customize the appearance of the progress bar. You can modify the styles as per your requirements.

3. Include the following JavaScript code in your web page to update the progress bar as the user scrolls:

```javascript
window.addEventListener('scroll', function() {
  const scrollDistance = document.documentElement.scrollHeight - window.innerHeight;
  const scrolled = (window.scrollY / scrollDistance) * 100;

  const progressBar = document.getElementById('progress-bar');
  progressBar.style.width = scrolled + '%';
});
```

## Customization

You can customize the progress bar's appearance by modifying the CSS styles for the `#progress-bar` selector in the included styles.
